## Please find attached completed Task 1 and 2.

Task 1 is a .MD file, and can be found on > KomiTestDummy/ExploratoryTest.md

Task 2 is a .MD file, and can be found KomiTestDummy/README.md

## This task has been created using Page Object Model – Java/Maven/BDD/Cucumber/Junit.
I chose to use the Page Object Model, as we should keep our tests and element locators separately, this will keep code clean and easy to understand and maintain.

I am aware you use cypress within the business however cypress is a tool I am very excited to learn. And if I was given the opportunity to join your team I will start practising/studying cypress, so I am up to speed come start date.
Please feel free to ask any other questions.
